## Tuple Access
**Complete the following exercises using the Python interpreter and record your answers in this file (you can edit in GitHub directly or in a local clone).**

```my_tuple = (1, 2, “kitten”,  4, “five”)```

1. How would I access the third element in the tuple? 
    my_tuple[2]
    
2. How would I access the element at the third index? 
    my_tuple[3] 

3. What would I get if I did `my_tuple[1]`?
    2

4. What are **three ways** I could access the last element of the tuple?<br>
    my_tuple[-1]
    my_tuple[4]
    my_tuple[len(my_tuple)-1]
(HINT: Look up the `len` method for Python tuples.)

5. How would I find the length of the tuple?
    len(my_tuple)

6. How would I update `my_tuple` to hold a new tuple that consists of the values of `my_tuple` plus the number 6 at the end? (Hint: look through the tuple lecture slides)
    my_tuple = my_tuple + (6,)

7. Use the tuple below to complete the following table (the first one is done for you):

```my_tuple = (1, 2, “kitten”,  4, “five”, 6, 7)```

| Access | Value |
|---------|----------|
| my_tuple[0]     | 1 |
| my_tuple[2:3]   | ('kitten',) |
| my_tuple[1:5]   | (2, 'kitten', 4, 'five')|
| my_tuple[1:10]  | (2, 'kitten', 4, 'five', 6, 7) |
| my_tuple[-1]    | 7 |
| my_tuple[-1:-4] | () |
| my_tuple[-4:]   | 4 |
